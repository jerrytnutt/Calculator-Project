# Calculator-Project
This is my implementation of the [Calculator Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) for The Odin Project.

The project combines HTML, CSS and pure Javascript for a working web calculator. Keyboard support is included.

A live demo can be seen here: [https://jerrytnutt.github.io/Calculator-Project/](https://jerrytnutt.github.io/Calculator-Project/)
