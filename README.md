# Calculator-Project
This is my implementation of the Calculator project for The Odin Project.

The project combines HTML, CSS and pure Javascript for a working web calculator. Keyboard support is included.

A live demo can be seen here: [https://jerrytnutt.github.io/Calculator-Project/](https://jerrytnutt.github.io/Calculator-Project/)
