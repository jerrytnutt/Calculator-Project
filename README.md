# Calculator-Project
This is my implementation of the Calculator project for The Odin Project
The project is around 95% complete, additional features and some minor tweaks will be added later.

# Features
* Contains proper functions for all of the basic math operators
* Clear data from screen
* Round long floating point numbers
* Check for basic calculator bugs (dividing by zero)
* Include keyboard shortcut
* Included a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number
